                    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Management Systems (AIMS)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What it is</h3>
                    <p>ISO/IEC 42001 is the world's first international standard designed to help organizations manage how they adopt, govern, and use artificial intelligence. It offers a structured approach for establishing and maintaining an Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS), helping firms apply AI responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with emerging legal frameworks.</p>

                    <h3>Why it matters for your firm</h3>
                    <p>AI is transforming how legal and accounting professionals conduct research, automate tasks, and analyze data. But with innovation comes increased risk. ISO/IEC 42001 helps ensure your use of AI tools—whether public, proprietary, or embedded—is safe, auditable, and aligned with ethical and regulatory expectations.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits for legal and accounting practices</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Demonstrates responsible AI use</strong> to clients and regulators</li>
                        <li><strong>Supports compliance</strong> with Quebec's Law 25 and Canada's CPPA (Bill C-27)</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduces liability</strong> from bias, data leaks, or unethical AI outcomes</li>
                        <li><strong>Aligns with ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST AI Risk Frameworks</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- ISO/IEC 27001 -->
                <div class="framework-section">
                    <div class="framework-code">ISO/IEC 27001</div>
                    <h2>Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What it is</h3>
                    <p>ISO/IEC 27001 is the global benchmark for building and maintaining a secure, risk-aware organization. It defines how to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.</p>

                    <h3>Why it matters for your firm</h3>
                    <p>Legal and accounting firms handle highly sensitive information—contracts, tax filings, financial statements, client records. ISO 27001 ensures that your firm has the tools, protocols, and training to prevent data breaches, reduce human error, and respond effectively to cyber threats.</p>

                    <h3>Business benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Builds resilience</strong> against cyberattacks and data loss</li>
                        <li><strong>Demonstrates compliance</strong> to clients, auditors, and regulators</li>
                        <li><strong>Supports vendor security</strong> due diligence and client RFPs</li>
                        <li><strong>Strengthens operational discipline</strong> and risk governance</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- SOC 2 -->
                <div class="framework-section">
                    <div class="framework-code">SOC 2</div>
                    <h2>Service Organization Controls (AICPA Trust Services Criteria)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What it is</h3>
                    <p>SOC 2 is an independent assurance report that evaluates your controls against the AICPA Trust Services Criteria—Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. A Type I report confirms control design at a point in time; a Type II report verifies those controls operate effectively across a review period (typically 6–12 months).</p>
                    <p>For firms running client portals, case/practice-management systems, DMS, and cloud/SaaS platforms, SOC 2 provides third-party validation of data protection and operational discipline.</p>

                    <h3>Why it matters for your firm</h3>
                    <p>Legal and accounting practices handle privileged files, working papers, trust-account data, and PII across multiple systems and vendors. SOC 2 helps you prove—to clients, regulators, and procurement teams—that access control, change management, vendor oversight, incident response, logging, backup/DR, and privacy are not only documented, but demonstrably effective.</p>
                    <p>The outcome: faster enterprise onboarding, fewer security questionnaires, and higher win rates in RFPs across Québec and the rest of Canada.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits for legal and accounting practices</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Builds client trust</strong> and accelerates RFP/vendor onboarding with a recognized report (Type I/Type II)</li>
                        <li><strong>Protects confidentiality and privilege</strong> for case files and discovery materials; maintains chain-of-custody expectations</li>
                        <li><strong>Strengthens audit readiness</strong> for working papers and evidence trails (immutability, time-stamping, monitoring)</li>
                        <li><strong>Supports compliance readiness</strong> for Québec's Law 25 and Canada's CPPA (Bill C-27) / PIPEDA</li>
                        <li><strong>Aligns with ISO 27001, ISO 42001, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls</strong> to simplify your control framework</li>
                        <li><strong>Improves vendor risk management</strong> for cloud/SaaS, e-signature, e-discovery, tax, and billing platforms</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduces breach and downtime risk</strong> through continuous control testing and incident-response rigor</li>
                    </ul>

                <!-- ISO 9001 -->
                <div class="framework-section">
                    <div class="framework-code">ISO 9001</div>
                    <h2>Quality Management Systems (QMS)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What it is</h3>
                    <p>ISO 9001 is the world's leading quality management standard, used by over a million organizations globally. It defines best practices for designing, delivering, and continuously improving consistent, client-focused services.</p>

                    <h3>Why it matters for your firm</h3>
                    <p>In legal and financial services, quality is not just about client satisfaction—it's about trust, risk reduction, and repeatable excellence. ISO 9001 ensures that your firm has well-documented procedures, trained staff, and a client-first culture embedded into daily operations.</p>

                    <h3>Key benefits for your practice</h3>

                    <h2>Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS)</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What it is</h3>
                    <p>ISO 22301 is the international standard for Business Continuity Management Systems. It helps organizations plan for, respond to, and recover from disruptive events—whether technical, environmental, or operational—by implementing a documented, proactive approach.</p>

                    <h3>Why it matters for your firm</h3>
                    <p>In a profession where deadlines are critical and downtime is costly, ISO 22301 ensures that your firm can remain operational during a crisis. From cyber incidents to natural disasters, this standard enables legal and accounting practices to uphold service delivery and meet regulatory requirements.</p>
