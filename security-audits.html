                            <h3>How often should we conduct security audits?</h3>
                            <p>Most organizations benefit from annual security audits, though the frequency depends on your industry, regulatory requirements, and risk profile. Organizations in highly regulated industries or those handling sensitive data may need quarterly or semi-annual audits. We recommend starting with an annual audit and adjusting based on your findings and business needs.</p>

                            <h3>What's the difference between a security audit and penetration testing?</h3>
                            <p>Security audits are comprehensive assessments that examine your security controls, policies, and configurations. They identify vulnerabilities and assess compliance. Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to test if vulnerabilities can actually be exploited. Many organizations use both: audits to find vulnerabilities, and penetration testing to validate their severity and test incident response.</p>

                            <h3>How long does a security audit take?</h3>
                            <p>Audit duration depends on the scope and complexity of your environment. A basic infrastructure audit might take 1-2 weeks, while a comprehensive audit covering infrastructure, applications, and policies typically takes 3-6 weeks. We work with you during the planning phase to establish realistic timelines that minimize disruption to your operations.</p>

                            <h3>Will the audit disrupt our operations?</h3>
                            <p>We design our audits to minimize disruption. Most of our testing can be performed during business hours without impacting normal operations. For any testing that might affect systems, we coordinate with your team to schedule during maintenance windows or low-usage periods. We always prioritize business continuity.</p>

                            <h3>What happens after the audit is complete?</h3>
                            <p>After delivering the audit report, we provide a presentation to both technical teams and executive leadership. We then offer ongoing remediation support, answering technical questions and providing guidance as you address findings. We also offer retesting services to verify that vulnerabilities have been properly fixed.</p>

                            <h3>How much does a security audit cost?</h3>
                            <p>Audit costs vary based on scope, complexity, and the size of your environment. A comprehensive security audit typically ranges from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on what's included. This investment is minimal compared to the cost of a data breach, which can reach into the millions. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific needs during the scoping phase.</p>
